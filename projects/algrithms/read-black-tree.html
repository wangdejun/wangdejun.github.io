	Every node is colored with either red or black.
	All leaf (nil) nodes are colored with black; if a nodeâ€™s child is missing then we will assume that it has a nil child in that place and this nil child is always colored black.
	Both children of a red node must be black nodes.
	Every path from a node n to a descendent leaf has the same number of black nodes (not counting node n). We call this number the black height of n, which is denoted by bh(n).
